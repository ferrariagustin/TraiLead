# TraiLead

## Introduction

### Project Description

When thinking about a startup, company, or organization, it involves a small group of people with a common purpose. As the project begins to grow, this small group of people is not enough, and the need to form teams naturally arises, to divide large tasks into smaller ones, and to delegate responsibilities. But forming a team is not just about hiring people and getting them to produce; it's about ensuring that new project members understand the purpose, the workflow dynamics, the technologies used, the project objectives, and building their expertise. And when we talk about expertise, which is "Knowledge of something, or skill in it, gained from one's direct involvement in it or exposure to it", it can be transmitted by those members who have a greater understanding of the project, those leaders who can pass on their skills to contribute to the project's growth.

In a world where needs change at a very rapid pace and the market becomes increasingly competitive, time becomes a critical factor for success. That's why achieving quality growth in a short amount of time requires a team where agility is one of its main virtues. This integrated project aims to contribute to agility so that new members can understand the project, the necessary technologies, work methodologies, and all the experience that more experienced members can provide. This will be possible through a mobile application tool that allows the transfer of experience, information, knowledge, and company regulations between those leaders and these apprentices or "trainees" who are taking their first steps within the company, startup, or organization. The application called TraiLead (Trai abbreviation of Trainee and Lead abbreviation of Leader) allows interaction between leaders and trainees, where leaders are responsible for managing the material they want to make available to trainees, whether it be documents, links, videos, etc. Trainees will be immediately notified to start the induction process into the knowledge required by the project.

In the following chapter, we will see some of the objectives of this project.

### Objectives

The "TraiLead" project aims to facilitate communication between project leaders and new trainees. Provide a tool that streamlines the induction or "onboarding" process of a trainee in an organization, making them feel supported and with easy access to all the necessary information to start their activities. On the other hand, decrease the workload of leaders who conduct this onboarding process to focus on other tasks within the organization without losing track of, or the progress of, new members.

The project also allows centralizing the onboarding process with information structures that can be reused for other trainees, contributing to the agility of this induction stage. In addition, metrics of this process can be obtained, such as the workload of leaders in this stage based on the number of trainees each one is responsible for, achieving a balance of effort for better performance.

#### Specific Objectives

- Reduce information update times in the induction stage in companies.
- Decrease human capital costs for the onboarding process.
- Facilitate the integration of new employees into companies or organizations.
- Provide a simple and secure application for both the company and new employees where they can centralize the onboarding process.
